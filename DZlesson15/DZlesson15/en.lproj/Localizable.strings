This is not surprising, because in the game of checkers, perhaps the most important attribute is a board, divided into cells. And the history of the origin of such a checkered board goes back to Ancient Egypt with its game Alkerk in the 1600s BC.
    Modern checkers were invented by the French, around the middle of the nineteenth century, who crossed the ancient Greek Alkerk with the game of chess. Checkers began to walk like a Queen in chess. In England, the game is still called - draughts - the queen's move in chess.
    The first World Drafts Championship was held in 1847. The winner was Andrew Anderson from Scotland. Since most of the games in the world championships ended in a draw, in 1890 the two-way prohibition rule was introduced - the first two moves were chosen absolutely randomly. In 1934, the rule was transformed into a three-way prohibition, when three moves were already chosen at random, but from the allowed list of combinations.";
